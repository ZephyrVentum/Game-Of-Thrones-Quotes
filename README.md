# Game-Of-Thrones-Quotes
A client app that implements [game-of-thrones-quotes-api](https://gameofthronesquotes.xyz/). I made this application for my own sake to understand the basic principles of developing native iOS applications. And also to show off that I mastered the development of iOS applications in just 1 week ðŸ˜œ.

The application is made according to the principles of Clean Swift architecture. This architecture is also called VIP.
